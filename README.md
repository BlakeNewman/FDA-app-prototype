[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cepinos/testing-travis-integration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cepinos/testing-travis-integration)

- assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted
- assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum two of the labor categories limited to the Development Pool labor categories to develop the prototype as quoted in Attachment C. The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services
- used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend etc)
- deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider was used
- wrote unit tests for their code
- set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider
- set up or used configuration management
- set up or used continuous monitoring
- deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization)
- used an interactive approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype
- provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine
- prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge
